## Cloud Run Monitoring and Error Logging Automation

This implementation is designed to set up Cloud Run monitoring and server-side error logging in your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project. Below is an overview of how the process works and the resources it will create in your GCP project.

---

### Features               
#### Cloud Run Monitoring                   
- **CPU and Memory Alert Policies:** Alerts are set up to monitor CPU and memory usage of specified Cloud Run services for your tagging services.
- **Uptime Check:** Regular checks to ensure the Cloud Run services are operational.
- **SSL Certificate Expiration Alert:** Alerts for SSL certificate expiration of Cloud Run services.
#### Server-Side Error Logging                
- **Logging Sink:** Server logs are routed to BigQuery for detailed analysis and storage. The logs will be stored in a dataset in our GCP project for dashboarding and further analysis purposes.

### Creating a Service Account and Generating a Key {#create-service-account-key}

To enable the automation of monitoring and management processes, you need to create a Google Cloud Service Account with specific permissions. Follow these steps to create the service account, assign the necessary roles, and generate a service account key for upload to our [portal](https://portal.code-cube.io/tag_monitor_config){:target="_blank"}.

#### Step 1: Create a Service Account

1. **Navigate to the Google Cloud Console**
    - Open the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. **Select Your Project:**
    - Ensure you have the correct project selected from the project selector dropdown at the top of the page.
3. **Go to the Service Accounts Page**
    - Navigate to `IAM & Admin` > `Service Accounts`.
4. **Create a New Service Account**
    - Click the `+ CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT` button.
    - Enter a name, ID, and description for the service account.
    - Click `CREATE AND CONTINUE`.

#### Step 2: Assign Roles to the Service Account

Assign the following roles to the service account to grant it the necessary permissions:

1. **Pub/Sub Admin:**
    - Resource: `google_pubsub_topic`
    - Role: `roles/pubsub.admin`
2. **Monitoring Notification Channel Admin:**
    - Resource: `google_monitoring_notification_channel`
    - Role: `roles/monitoring.notificationChannelAdmin`
3. **Monitoring Alert Policy Admin:**
    - Resource: `google_monitoring_alert_policy`
    - Role: `roles/monitoring.alertPolicyAdmin`
4. **Service Account Admin:**
    - Resources: `google_pubsub_topic_iam_member`, `google_project_iam_binding`
    - Role: `roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin`
5. **Pub/Sub Admin:**
    - Resource: `google_pubsub_subscription`
    - Role: `roles/pubsub.admin`
6. **Monitoring Uptime Check Admin:**
    - Resource: `google_monitoring_uptime_check_config`
    - Role: `roles/monitoring.uptimeCheckAdmin`
7. **Logging Admin:**
    - Resource: `google_logging_project_sink`
    - Role: `roles/logging.admin`
8. **Config Writer:**
    - Resource: `google_logging_project_sink`
    - Role: `roles/config.writer`
    - After adding all the roles, click `DONE`.  

**Note**: You can also set the **owner** role to include all above-mentioned permissions to the service account at once. 

#### Step 3: Create and Download the Service Account Key

1. **Generate a New Key:**
    - In the `Service Accounts` page, find the service account you created.
    - Click the `â‹®` (three vertical dots) at the end of the service account row, then click `Manage keys`.
2. **Add Key:**
    - Click `ADD KEY` > `Create new key`.
3. **Select Key Type:**
    - Choose the `JSON` key type and click `CREATE`.
4. **Download Key:**
    - The key will automatically download to your computer. Keep this file secure, as it contains the credentials required to access the service account.

#### Step 4: Upload the Service Account Key to Our Portal

1. **Access Our Portal:**
    - Log in to our [portal](https://portal.code-cube.io/tag_monitor_config){:target="_blank"} where the key is required for upload.
2. **Upload the Key:**
    - Navigate to the section where the service account key upload is requested.
    - Click the `Upload` button and select the JSON key file you downloaded earlier.
    - Follow any additional instructions provided to complete the upload process.

By completing these steps, you will have successfully created a service account with the required permissions and provided the necessary credentials for our portal to automate and manage processes effectively.

### Identifying Cloud Run Services and Their Regions {#locate-cloud-run-resources}

To manage and monitor your Cloud Run services, you need to know the name and region of each service used for your tagging service. Follow these steps to locate your Cloud Run services and identify their corresponding names and regions.

#### Step 1: Navigate to the Cloud Run Console

1. **Open the Google Cloud Console:**
    - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. **Select Your Project:**
    - Ensure you have the correct project selected from the project selector dropdown at the top of the page.
3. **Access Cloud Run:**
    - From the navigation menu, go to `Cloud Run` under the `Serverless` section.

#### Step 2: View Cloud Run Services

1. **List of Services:**
    - On the Cloud Run page, you will see a list of all Cloud Run services deployed in your project.
2. **Service Details:**
    - Each row in the list represents a Cloud Run service. The primary details displayed include:
        - **Service Name:** The name of the Cloud Run service.
        - **Region:** The region where the service is deployed.

#### Step 3: Identify Service Name and Region

1. **Service Name:**
    - The service name is displayed in the `Service` column. This is the identifier you use to manage and reference the service within your project.
2. **Region:**
    - The region is displayed in the `Region` column. This indicates the geographical location where the service is deployed, which is crucial for understanding latency and data residency.

By following these steps, you will be able to easily locate all Cloud Run services within your project and identify their names and regions needed for the implementation.
