## Granting access to raw Tag Monitoring data
To access datasets shared by Code Cube, follow these steps:

1. Set up Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Project                      
If you donâ€™t have a GCP project already set up, you will need to create one. You can create a new project from the GCP Console.

2. Provide Gmail Account                       
Please provide us with a Gmail account that you would like to use to access the shared dataset. This Gmail account will be added as a subscriber to the dataset listing.

3. Access Shared Dataset                
Once your Gmail account has been added as a subscriber, we will provide you with a shared link to the data exchange. Click on the provided link to access the dataset.            
  <img src="/../images/shared-dataset.png"
    alt="add-dataset"
    height=800
    width=800
    class="big-img"
    >                             

4. Add Dataset to Your Project                    
After accessing the shared link, you will be directed to the dataset. Add the dataset to your GCP project by following the prompts.
5. Find the Dataset in BigQuery              



Once the dataset has been added to your project, you can find it in your BigQuery console. Navigate to BigQuery from the GCP Console to view and analyze the shared dataset.
