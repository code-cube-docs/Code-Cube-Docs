# Tag Inactivity Monitoring

## Product Description 

Tag Inactivity Monitoring is a solution designed to help users monitor important tags, such as conversion tags, and receive timely notifications when the tag does not fire for more than an hour. This solution is useful for ensuring that critical tags are working properly, and for quickly identifying issues that may be impacting business operations.

The Tag Inactivity Monitoring solution sends notifications to users via email or Slack, informing them that the tag has not fired and providing details on the last time the tag was fired. This allows users to easily spot and troubleshoot the issue. The solution is available for use from 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM, making it an ideal tool for businesses that operate during regular business hours.

Overall, the Tag Inactivity Monitoring solution provides an easy-to-use, convenient way for businesses to monitor critical tags and quickly identify issues that may be impacting their operations.
