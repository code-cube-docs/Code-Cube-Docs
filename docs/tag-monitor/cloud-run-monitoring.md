## Feature description

This feature helps you monitor your Google Tag Manager (GTM) tagging servers on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using the Cloud Run service. It ensures that your servers stay healthy, secure, and running smoothly. It automatically sets up monitoring rules in your GCP project, such as checking memory and CPU usage, verifying SSL certificates, and making sure your servers are always up and running. This allows you to keep an eye on your tagging servers and make sure they are working properly.

The main goal of this feature is to keep your tagging servers reliable so your data collection is uninterrupted. This way, you can focus on analyzing and improving your marketing campaigns without worrying abut technical problems.
If anything goes wrong, youâ€™ll be notified right away through your preferred method, whether by email or Slack. This helps you quickly fix any issues that is detected to make sure your GTM server continues to provide the data you need.

## How it works

To get started with this monitoring feature, you'll first need to provide us with a service account key from your GCP project. This key should have the necessary permissions to create and manage resources within your project. The instructions of how to create the service account key and the necessary permissions are explained in further steps.

The setup involves configuring a comprehensive set of alert policies to monitor the performance and health of your Cloud Run services. These policies include tracking CPU and memory usage to ensure your services are operating efficiently, performing uptime checks to verify continuous service availability, and monitoring SSL certificate expiration to maintain security. Additionally, a Pub/Sub topic is configured along with a corresponding subscription that receives messages from the notification channels defined in the alert policies. These messages are then forwarded to a Cloud Function within our GCP project, enabling efficient handling and routing of notifications. This setup ensures that any issues are promptly detected and addressed, maintaining the reliability and security of your services.

Additionally, we will set up a service account specifically for monitoring with the necessary IAM roles to manage and access these resources.

Once everything is in place, the monitoring system will actively keep an eye on your Cloud Run services. If any issues arise, you will receive notifications through your preferred channels, such as email or Slack, so you can quickly address any problems and ensure your tagging infrastructure remains reliable.

### Identifying Cloud Run Services and Their Regions {#locate-cloud-run-resources}

To manage and monitor your Cloud Run services, you need to know the name and region of each service used for your tagging service. Follow these steps to locate your Cloud Run services and identify their corresponding names and regions.

#### Step 1: Navigate to the Cloud Run Console

1. **Open the Google Cloud Console:**
    - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. **Select Your Project:**
    - Ensure you have the correct project selected from the project selector dropdown at the top of the page.
3. **Access Cloud Run:**
    - From the navigation menu, go to `Cloud Run` under the `Serverless` section.
    <img src="/../images/GCP-monitoring/cloud-run-tab.png"
    alt="Cloud Run tab"
    height=900
    width=900
    class="big-img"
        >

#### Step 2: View Cloud Run Services

1. **List of Services:**
    - On the Cloud Run page, you will see a list of all Cloud Run services deployed in your project.
2. **Service Details:**
    - Each row in the list represents a Cloud Run service. The primary details displayed include:
        - **Service Name:** The name of the Cloud Run service.
        - **Region:** The region where the service is deployed.
        <img src="/../images/GCP-monitoring/cloud-run-details.png"
        alt="Cloud Run tab"
        height=900
        width=900
        class="big-img"
            >


#### Step 3: Identify Service Name and Region

1. **Service Name:**
    - The service name is displayed in the `Service` column. This is the identifier you use to manage and reference the service within your project.
2. **Region:**
    - The region is displayed in the `Region` column. This indicates the geographical location where the service is deployed, which is crucial for understanding latency and data residency.

By following these steps, you will be able to easily locate all Cloud Run services within your project and identify their names and regions needed for the implementation.

### Security Measures and Implementation Safeguards {#security-measures-and-implementation-safeguards}

Our implementation process is built around a strong security framework that safeguards user data and blocks unauthorized access. Here's how we maintain top-level security throughout the process:

1. **One-Time Use of Service Account Key:**
    - We keep your service account key secure by using it only once. The service account key, necessary for implementation, is never stored in our databases. This means that after the initial implementation, the key is discarded. Should you need to update your setup, you will be required to upload the key again. This approach eliminates any potential vulnerabilities associated with key storage.
2. **Strict Separation of Front-End and Back-End Processing:**
    - To minimize risk, the service account key file is never handled on the front-end. Instead, when you upload the key, it is sent as a binary file via secure HTTPS requests directly to our servers. By processing the key exclusively on the back-end, we prevent any exposure of sensitive information in the front-end environment, adding an extra layer of protection against potential security breaches.
3. **No Credentials Stored:**
    - In the event of a security breach, your credentials remain safe. Since we do not store the service account key or any sensitive credentials in our system, even a successful hack would yield no access to your Google Cloud resources. This ensures that your data and accounts remain secure, regardless of external threats.
4. **Limited Scope of Resource Creation:**
    - Our implementation is highly targeted and precise. We only create the resources explicitly required for the project within your Google Cloud environment, and nothing more. This controlled and minimalistic approach ensures that there are no unnecessary permissions or resources that could be exploited, further tightening security.            
    [See the list of resources that will be created in your GCP project](#GCP-respurces)

By following these strict security practices, we secure your implementation, reducing risk and protecting your Google Cloud environment.
