# Tag Bulk Edit

## Update all your tags to include the tag name in the metadata

To effectively monitor your tags and ensure they include necessary metadata, follow these comprehensive steps to configure your client-side Tag Manager container.

### Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Access the Tag Monitor Configuration Page

Begin by navigating to the [Tag Monitor configuration page](https://portal.code-cube.io/tag_monitor_config){:target="_blank"} on the Code Cube portal. This is the starting point for setting up your tag monitoring and editing configuration.

### Step 2: Select the Error Monitoring Tab

Once on the configuration page, you will see different tabs for various monitoring options. Click on either the "Client-side" or "Server-side error monitoring" tab, depending on your needs.

### Step 3: Locate the Bulk Editing Tag Names Section                                 

Scroll down to find the section labeled "Bulk editing tag names." This section is crucial for updating your tags. Click the "Start bulk editing" button to initiate the process.

### Step 7: Run the Update                      

With the container selected, click the "Run update" button. This will initiate the bulk editing process where your tags will be updated to include the tag names in their metadata.

### Step 8: Publish the Changes                   

After the update process completes, a confirmation message will appear at the bottom of the page. To finalize the changes, navigate to the container in your Google Tag Manager account. Locate the newly generated workspace named "Code Cube" and publish the changes.
