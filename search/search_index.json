Tag Monitor uses Google Tag Management which is a tag delivery system that allows you to quickly and easily update measurement codes and related code fragments (collectively known as tags) on a website or mobile app. Tag monitoring will allow you to understand if important tags are actually firing for real users and see when they break down in a well formatted table. </p>"},{"location":"tag-monitor/a-tag-monitor/#how-it-works","title":"How it works","text":"<p>The key deliverable of Tag monitor is a BigQuery view that collects data from a website. This is supported by a Cloud Function that collects the pixel and stores it into BigQuery. The data will be sent by way of a new Google Tag Manager custom template, and it will comprise statistics of all the tags (or a random portion of it) that have fired on the website for any given dataLayer event.</p> <p></p> <p>The basic setup of the monitor collects the following metadata from each dataLayer event: - Event name and timestamp (to uniquely distinguish events with the same name from each other). - Tag ID, name, firing status, and execution time for every tag that fired for that event (or null if no tags fired for the event).</p> <p>This solution can be easily extended to include other metadata, like container ID, domain etc.</p>"},{"location":"tag-monitor/error-monitoring-client-side/","title":"client-side Tag Monitor Implementation","text":""},{"location":"tag-monitor/error-monitoring-client-side/#how-to-set-up-the-tag-monitor","title":"How to set up the tag monitor","text":"<p>To implement the Tag Monitor for a client in Google Cloud Platform, please follow these steps accordingly.         </p>"},{"location":"tag-monitor/error-monitoring-client-side/#1-make-sure-the-code-cube-infrastructure-is-ready","title":"1.
