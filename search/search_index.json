Select the template you just created from the tag type selector. Now you need to configure the tag. There are three fields you need to set: - Project ID \u2013 set to the GCP project ID of the project where the BigQuery table is. If it\u2019s the same project as the one running your Server container, you can leave this field blank. - Dataset ID \u2013 set to the Dataset ID of the BigQuery table. - Table ID \u2013 set to the Table ID of the BigQuery table.</p> <p>Note: You will be given the value for the above-mentioned field from us.       Expand Advanced Settings and scroll down to Additional Tag Metadata.

For 10% of the events, choose Random number -&gt; ends with -&gt; 1. For other cases, calculate the expected percentage from 2,147,483,647 (Random Number value) and fire the tag in that number of cases. For example, if you need to limit Tag Monitor firing to 5% of events, use: Random number -&gt; less than or equals to -&gt; 107,374,182 (2,147,483,647*0.05).        </p> </li> <li> <p>Update all your tags to include the tag name metadata      For each tag, expand the Advanced Settings and check the Include tag name checkbox under Additional Tag Metadata.

If needed, you can add even more key-value pairs to the tag metadata \u2013 you just need to modify the monitoring template to add these to the BigQuery API call. And, of course, you need a BigQuery table schema that accepts the new values.                    </p> </li> <li> <p>Check results     Open Preview and validate that everything works as expected. Note that in the server container preview mode a webpage is not opened automatically, so you should manually open it to see the data streaming. Another way to validate that Tag Monitor is working is to check the results in the BigQuery table.   </p> <p>Note: To check the results in preview, you need to open the preview on GTM client container simultaneously with the server-side preview. </p> </li> <li> <p>Grant Permission     This can be done in IAM &amp; Admin &gt; Service Accounts in Google Cloud Platform.
