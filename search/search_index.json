For 10% of the events choose: Random number ends with 1. For other cases, calculate the expected percentage from 2,147,483,647 (Random Number value) and fire the tag in that number of cases. For example, if you need to limit Tag Monitor firing to 5% of events, use: Random number is less than or equals to 107,374,182 (2,147,483,647*0.05).
